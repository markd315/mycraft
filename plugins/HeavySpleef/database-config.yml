# Database configuration for HeavySpleef
# This config includes database connections
# and other details for database modules

# Manage your database modules here
# Please note that you can only use
# a sql database for statistics due
# to performance issues on xml

  statistics:
    enabled: true

    # For experts only
    # Specify the maximim account of statistics
    # which will be cached (other statistics will be evicted from
    # the cache and need to be loaded again from the database)
    max-cache-size: 1024

# This is for advanced users only.
# HeavySpleef automatically handles
# your required database connections if
# you keep this untouched. If you want to
# use MySQL for statistic persistence you need
# to edit this section

# Specify your database connection
# details here.
