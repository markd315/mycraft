#Configuration for the chest item ratios
#this system works by levels. Level 1 aka lvl1 
#is the most common stuff whereas lvl16 is the least 
#common. You can set what will spawn at each level below.
#The ratio setting determines how likely the next level is
#to spawn in. a ratio of 2 means that it is twice as unlikely
#for the next level to spawn in.
