#   100 rarity mean 1/6 chance than other ( with 6 default normal biomes).
#   50 rarity mean 1/11 chance than other
# For isle biome this is chance to spawn isle in good place.

# BiomeHeight mean how much height will be added in terrain generation
# It is double value from -10.0 to 10.0
# Value 0.0 equivalent half of map height with all other default settings
BiomeHeight:0.0

# Biome volatility.
BiomeVolatility:3.6

# If this value is greater than 0, then it will affect how much, on average, the terrain will rise before leveling off when it begins to increase in elevation.
# If the value is less than 0, then it will cause the terrain to either increase to a lower height before leveling out or decrease in height if the value is a large enough negative.
MaxAverageHeight:-2.6

# If this value is greater than 0, then it will affect how much, on average, the terrain (usually at the ottom of the ocean) will fall before leveling off when it begins to decrease in elevation. 
# If the value is less than 0, then it will cause the terrain to either fall to a lesser depth before leveling out or increase in height if the value is a large enough negative.
MaxAverageDepth:1.1

# Another type of noise. This noise is independent from biomes. The larger the values the more chaotic/volatile landscape generation becomes.
# Setting the values to negative will have the opposite effect and make landscape generation calmer/gentler.
Volatility1:0.0
Volatility2:0.0

# Adjust the weight of the corresponding volatility settings. This allows you to change how prevalent you want either of the volatility settings to be in the terrain.
VolatilityWeight1:0.5
VolatilityWeight2:0.45

# Disable all noises except Volatility1 and Volatility2. Also disable default block chance from height.
DisableBiomeHeight:false

# List of custom height factor, 17 double entries, each entire control of about 7 blocks height from down. Positive entry - better chance of spawn blocks, negative - smaller
# Values which affect your configuration may be found only experimental. That may be very big, like ~3000.0 depends from height

# This section control all resources spawning after terrain generation
# So first line is first resource which will be placed. Second line - second resource.
# By default this set to be near notch settings.

# Possible resources:
# SmallLake(Block[.BlockData],Frequency,Rarity,MinAltitude,MaxAltitude)
# Dungeon(Frequency,Rarity,MinAltitude,MaxAltitude)
# UnderGroundLake(MinSize,MaxSize,Frequency,Rarity,MinAltitude,MaxAltitude)

# Vines(Frequency,Rarity,MinAltitude,MaxAltitude)
# 
# Some comments:  
# Block and BlockSource - can be id or name, Frequency - is count of attempts for place resource
# Rarity - chance for each attempt, Rarity:100 - mean 100% to pass, Rarity:1 - mean 1% to pass
# MinAltitude and MaxAltitude - height limits
# BlockSource - mean where or whereupon resource will be placed 
# CustomObject resource - mean where in queue custom object will be trying to place
# Tree types: 
#      Tree
#      BigTree
#      Forest
#      HugeMushroom
#      SwampTree
#      Taiga1
#      Taiga2
#      JungleTree
#      GroundBush
#      CocoaTree
# TreeType_Chance - similar Rarity. Example:
#   Tree(10,Taiga1,35,Taiga2,100) - plugin trying to 10 attempts, in each attempt he try place Taiga1 ( 35% chance ) if not he place Taiga2 (100% chance)
# Plant resource used for place something like flower, small mushrooms, pumpkins
# Liquid resource is one block water or lava source
